# Evothings-bluemix-painter


This blog is about how to resolve the issues when one is working with Evothings Studion and unable to connect to the IBM Bluemix IoT Watson platform.

The problem could be because the user id and the password has expired.
Login to the console.ng.bluemix.net and create a new set of authentication and enter that into the Evothings studio code in order to be able to authenticate and login from the studio and thereby enabling the application.
